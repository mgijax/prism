  (or tab out of the field). The first image for the J# is opened automatically.
  If the J# has no figures in the database (or cannot be found), an error message

  <div class="hlp-hdr">See a given figure and its panes:</div>
  <div class="hlp-txt">Click on the figure label in the table on the left. The image for the figure
  is displayed. If pane coordinates have already been defined, the corresponding overlays are also displayed.
  If there is no corresponding image, "No image available" is displayed. (Eventually, will provide the 
  ability to upload image files and associate them with figures.)

   <div class="hlp-hdr">Split regions into two:</div>
   <div class="hlp-txt">Select the region(s) to split. Then Option-click (hold down the
   Option (or Alt) key while clicking). All selected regions will be split
   along a horizontal line though the clicked location. (Regions not intersected by the
   hirizontal are unaffected.) To split
   along the vertical, also hold down the Shift key (Option-Shift-click).

  <div class="hlp-hdr">Select region(s):</div>
  <div class="hlp-txt">Click on it. To select multiple regions, hold the shift key
  down while clicking. Also: If an image pane has coordinates, then clicking on the pane's row
  in the table will select the region in the image. Also: clicking the button "SelectAll" will select
  all regions.

  <div class="hlp-txt">Select the region(s) to delete and click the "Delete" button (or type the corresp.

<div class="hlp-entry">
  <div class="hlp-hdr">Associate a pane with a region:</div>
  <div class="hlp-txt">Option 1: Drag the pane label from the table and drop onto the desired region. Option 2: click "OnePane" to associate a single pane with the entire image area. Option 3: Click "ClickAssign" (note: the button stays depressed), and then click the regions in order. Panes will be assigned in order. You may click on a different panelabel (in the table) to start/continue from a different point. When you are done, click "ClickAssign" again, to reset the button. Option 4: Click "GridAssign". Autoassigns all panes in order to defined regions in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order. Option 4 works better when you have defined regions by splitting rather than by drawing freehand.
